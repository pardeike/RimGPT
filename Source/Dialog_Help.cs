You must provide the necessary API keys yourself, as the overall demand for this free mod would be too costly. Your task is to create the required accounts, connect them with a credit card (if necessary), and add a minimum amount to their balance. If you are going to use a locally hosted AI model, you still need to setup a Microsoft Azure account for Text-to-Speech services. 

To set up the mod, please navigate to the AI Configuration menu by clicking on the 'AI Config' button. There, you can get further instructions on each AI Provider, add your API keys, and set up your local models." },
